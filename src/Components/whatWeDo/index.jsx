              We are verifying each Seller's genuinity by running background
              checks on company registration and owners as well as doing product
              and coresponding SKU verifications. Each store verified by us has
              an official Verified by Kaijooâ„¢ icon next to their name. If you
              are a store owner and would like to verify your store with us,
              please go to our Seller Sign Up page and we will reach out to you
              with next steps.
